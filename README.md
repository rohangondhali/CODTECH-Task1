Project: Network Security Analysis Tool

Objective: Create a tool that analyzes network security by identifying open ports and outdated software versions.

Functionalities:

1. Open Port Scanning: Utilizes nmap to scan open ports on a specified target.
    - The scan_open_ports function takes a target and port range as input and returns a list of open ports.
2. Outdated Software Detection: Utilizes BeautifulSoup and requests to analyze a web page and detect outdated software versions.
    - The check_outdated_software function takes a URL as input and returns a list of outdated software.

Dependencies:

- nmap: for scanning open ports
- requests: for making HTTP requests
- BeautifulSoup: for parsing HTML and detecting outdated software

Summary:

This project creates a network security analysis tool that helps identify vulnerabilities in a network. The tool scans open ports using nmap and detects outdated software versions by analyzing web pages. This enables network administrators to take measures to improve their network's security.
